    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups ketchup</li>

        <li>Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, eggs, grated onion, soy sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of meat mixture per meatball and roll into small meatballs. Arrange meatballs in a large, deep baking dish.</li>
